A Pen created on CodePen.

Original URL: [https://codepen.io/chrisota/pen/RwZWJO](https://codepen.io/chrisota/pen/RwZWJO).

Problem:Create a menu for a desktop dashboard application with sub menu items.

Solution: A left hand, collapsable menu was created to allow more data to be displayed within the main content area of the dashboard. Sub menu items are accessible via accordion on expanded view or via drop down on collapsed view.

Notes: This exercise was repurposed and simplified from a real project I worked on.
