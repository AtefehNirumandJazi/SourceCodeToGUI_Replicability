# Replicability Package: Source Code to B-UML Model Generation

This repository provides the replicability package for our study on automated extraction of Structural and IFML-like GUI models from source code. It contains the datasets and generated artifacts required to reproduce the experimental results reported in the paper.

The package supports the evaluation of the proposed pipeline on real-world web interfaces, enabling transparent validation and reuse by the research community.


## Structure

- **Input_Data**:
Contains the original source artifacts used as inputs for the experiments:
  - *CodePen Dataset*: Includes 100 CodePen case studies, covering diverse UI styles, layouts, and interaction patterns.
  - *WebSight Dataset*: Includes 100 WebSight case studies, representing real-world web pages with varying structural and visual complexity.

- **Output_Data**:
Contains the artifacts generated by the proposed approach:
  - *Structural Models*: Platform-independent structural models automatically extracted from the source code.
  - *IFML-like GUI Models*: IFML-like GUI models capturing screens, layouts, components, and visual properties.
